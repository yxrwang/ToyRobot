The program was written in Java. It is a Java command line application. There is a compiled Jar file ToyRobot.jar in the project folder with test command input files.

If you want to see or compile from the source code, please use IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to open the project, making sure JDK version 7.0 and above must be installed.

How to run the program:

- Open the command line tool
- Go to the project root folder where ToyRobot.jar is located.
- Use command: java -jar ToyRobot.jar test test1 test2
- The app runs and you will be able to see the output in the console.

The arguments test test1 test2 are the input test file names, you can add your own test file as well.

Thanks,
